# Risks and Mitigations  

## Technical Challenges

### Prayer Time Calculation Accuracy
- Risk: Incorrect calculations leading to wrong prayer times
- Mitigation: Use established libraries (adhan.js), implement multiple calculation methods, allow user adjustments, validate against known sources

### Google API Rate Limits
- Risk: Hitting API quotas with many users
- Mitigation: Implement caching, batch operations, progressive sync, use exponential backoff

### Location Services Reliability
- Risk: Inaccurate or unavailable location data
- Mitigation: Manual location entry fallback, location validation, saved locations, IP-based approximation

### Calendar Sync Conflicts
- Risk: Duplicate events or sync failures
- Mitigation: Idempotent operations, conflict resolution logic, sync status tracking, manual refresh option

## User Experience Risks

### Complex Onboarding
- Risk: Users abandoning during setup
- Mitigation: Progressive disclosure, sensible defaults, skip options, clear value communication

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Risk: Offending users with inappropriate design/content
- Mitigation: Community feedback, Islamic design guidelines, multiple calculation methods, customization options

### Privacy Concerns
- Risk: Users worried about location/calendar data
- Mitigation: Clear privacy policy, minimal data collection, local storage options, data deletion features

## Development Risks

### Scope Creep
- Risk: Adding too many features delaying MVP
- Mitigation: Clear phase definitions, feature flags, user feedback prioritization, MVP focus

### Third-party Dependency
- Risk: Google API changes or deprecation
- Mitigation: Abstraction layers, alternative providers research, API version pinning, migration plans
